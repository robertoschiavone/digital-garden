## Definition

The *Chebyshev distance* between two vectors or points $x$ and $y$, with standard coordinates $x_i$ and $y_i$,
respectively, is

$$
D_{\text{Chebyshev}} (x, y)\coloneqq \max_i (\lvert x_i - y_i \rvert).
$$

This equals the limit of the $L_p$ metrics:

$$
\lim_{p \to \infty} \left(\sum^{n}_{i = 1} \lvert x_i - y_i\rvert^p\right)^{1 / p},
$$

hence it is also known as the $\text{L}_\infty$ metric.

## Example

Let's say we have two points in a 2-dimensional space: Point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and Point $B$ with
coordinates $(x_2, y_2)$. The *Chebyshev distance* between these two points can be computed as follows:

1. **Calculate Absolute Differences:** compute the absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of the two
points.
 - Absolute difference in $x$-coordinates: $\lvert x_2 - x_1 \rvert$
 - Absolute difference in $y$-coordinates: $\lvert y_2 - y_1 \rvert$

2. **Find Maximum Absolute Difference:** compare the absolute differences calculated in step 1 and choose the larger of
the two values. The maximum absolute difference is the *Chebyshev distance* between the two points.

Suppose we have Point $A$ with coordinates $(2, 5)$ and Point $B$ with coordinates $(7, 9)$.

1. **Calculate Absolute Differences:**
 - absolute difference in $x$-coordinates: $\lvert 7 - 2 \rvert = 5$
 - absolute difference in $y$-coordinates: $\lvert 9 - 5 \rvert = 4$

2. **Find Maximum Absolute Difference:** the *Chebyshev distance* between points $A$ and $B$ is $5$ because it's the
larger of the two absolute differences computed above.
